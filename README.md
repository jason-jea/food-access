## Learning about food access and distribution!

Trying to better understand issues of equity and access for food in America- especially how they intersect with race and class, and how they are impacted by American supply chains, economic policies, and general urban development.  This is a repository for data scratchwork to try and contextualize some of the whitepapers and books I'm reading on the side.


No real structure to how I'm organizing files yet, might end up moving things around based on topic. The `style.css` and corresponding fonts/img/js dirs are copied over from my personal Github Pages site and allows me to easily transfer over knit notebooks.
